    "# Weak Supervision (Gaussian Toy Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the basics of weak supervision in the context of anomaly detection. \n",
    "We will use simple Gaussian toy data to demonstrate the basic concepts. \n",
    "For a similar demonstration on realistic physics data, see the `weak_supervision.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual approach to find a powerful discriminant for distinguishing two classes of data (here signal and background) from each other, is to train a machine learning classifier (e.g. a neural network) to distinguish the classes from each other, based on some input features $x$. At each training iteration, we compare the output of the classifier $f(x)$ to the actual label $y$ (1 for signal, 0 for background) of the training data via the loss function (usually binary cross entropy) and optimize the weights of the classifier such that they match as well as possible. What the classifier learns then is to approximate the likelihood ratio $\\frac{p_{sig}}{p_{bkg}}$, which is the most powerful test statistic according to the Neyman Pearson Lemma. This *fully supervised classifier* relies on knowing a-priori which training data are signal and which are background during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there might be cases where one does not have such truth labels in advance. This is often the case in anomaly detection where one searches for small hints of anomalous signal within an overwhelming background, without knowing ahead of time what the signal looks like. In this case we only have our measured data, that consists of background and maybe some signal. We do not know the true 'label' of any of these data events, so we cannot perform traditional supervised training.\n",
    "In addition, we somehow got an extra sample of just background data. If that was the case, we could just train a classifier to distinguish these two classes (data=sig+bkg vs bkg). Our classifier would approach a likelihood ratio that is monotonically linked to the signal-vs-bkg one $\\frac{p_{(sig+bkg)}}{p_{bkg}} = \\frac{f_{sig} p_{sig} + (1- f_{sig}) p_{bkg}}{p_{bkg}} = f_{sig} \\frac{p_{sig}}{p_{bkg}} + (1 - f_{sig})$ where $f_{sig}$ is the (unknown) signal fraction in the data.\n",
    "This method of training is called weak supervision. \n",
    "\n",
    "A significant challenge in the application of this method is where to get the magic background-only sample. One might have a very good Monte Carlo simulation, or one might instead generate it in-situ via some data-driven estimate. The latter is the approach that multiple weak supervision methods take, such as [CWoLa Hunting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02634), [SALAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10579), [CATHODE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00546), [CURTAINS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09470), [FETA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11285). For now, we just assume we already have such a large background-only sample. We often refer to this idealization as the *idealized anomaly detector* (IAD).\n"
